### [TODO] Re-upload data from 2018 to 2021 October

Data from 2018 to 2021 will need to separately be re-uploaded into monthly folders. Keep the duplicates outside, it matches an older style (hint: ClassicShell wallpaper collection file structure)

Chore difficulty level: 0.1/10.0 (as easy as it gets)

Steps:

1. Download the repository

2. Upload images into the folders assigned to them

3. Leave a reply and close this issue
