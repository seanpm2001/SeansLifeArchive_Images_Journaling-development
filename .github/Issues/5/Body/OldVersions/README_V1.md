[TODO] Get pictures for journaling data from 2016 to 2018

I originally didn't look at the fact that I can get a screenshot at any time, not the day at the end of the month on the specific year. This task is easy, just go back and get pictures.

Steps:

1. Get the pictures (GNOME screenshot, or whatever screenshot tool you are using at the time)

2. Upload images into the folders assigned to them

3. Leave a reply and close this issue
